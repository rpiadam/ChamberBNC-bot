Project Backlog
===============

Bot Operations
--------------

- [ ] Ensure the service connects to every configured network and joins `#bnc.im`.
- [ ] Implement resilient reconnect handling for timeouts or dropped sessions.
- [ ] Authenticate reliably with NickServ (SASL/NickServ fallback).
- [ ] Rejoin all configured `#bnc.im`-related channels after reconnects.

bnc.im Platform
---------------

- [ ] Process user onboarding requests end-to-end (email verification, account creation).
- [ ] Maintain and enforce an email blacklist to block abusive sign-ups.
- [ ] Relay `#bnc.im` traffic seamlessly across all linked networks.
- [ ] Support both network-wide and per-server broadcast messages from IRC.
